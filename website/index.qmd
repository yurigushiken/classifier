## Project Overview

This study examines how Mandarin-speaking children acquire numeral classifiers, with particular focus on the **overgeneralization of the general classifier 个 (ge)**. Children acquiring Mandarin must learn which classifier conventionally pairs with which noun, a well-documented developmental challenge.

### Research Questions (Working)

1. What is the distribution and frequency of classifier use in children's spontaneous speech?
2. To what extent do children overgeneralize 个 (ge) to nouns requiring specific classifiers?
3. How does classifier use change as a function of age?
4. Do patterns differ by speaker role (child vs. adult input)?
5. What is the relationship between numerosity contexts and classifier choice?

## Current Status
The pipeline has completed Phases 1 and 2 (corpus inventory and deterministic extraction) and Phase 3 prompt validation. A **20-row random PI review sample** has been annotated with DeepSeek v3.2-speciale. The full 70,655-row production run is pending PI approval of the output schema and annotation quality. Estimated cost for the full run is **$120 to $140**. All production results will require human verification. The pipeline includes automated flags to prioritize rows most likely to need review.
